# scraper
A simple webscraper written for a friend to bulk-download pics from a party we attended.

Commented code can be enabled in order to make it multithreaded, but had to leave it out since it spawned too many concurrent connections such tht the server kicked me out. Can be handled in a better way to avoid that, but I didn't bother since we only needed a couple of thousand images...
